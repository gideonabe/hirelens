# HireLens

🚀 **HireLens** is an open-source platform designed to make the hiring process easier for **both recruiters and job seekers**.  

The goal is to integrate **AI-powered analytics** (using Hugging Face free models) to help recruiters evaluate candidates more efficiently and provide job seekers with clearer insights into how they present themselves.  

👉 Current state:  
- ✅ Frontend built with **Next.js + Tailwind CSS**  
- ✅ Backend powered by **Node.js**  
- ✅ Deployed on **Vercel**  
- 🔄 Upcoming: **AI integration with Hugging Face models** for candidate/job insights
